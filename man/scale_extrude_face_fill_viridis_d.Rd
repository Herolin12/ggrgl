\usage{
scale_extrude_face_fill_viridis_d(
  ...,
  alpha = 1,
  begin = 0,
  end = 1,
  direction = 1,
  option = "D",

  option = "D",
  values = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to [discrete_scale()],
[continuous_scale()], or [binned_scale] to control name, limits, breaks,
  labels and so forth.}

\item{begin, end, alpha, direction, option, values, space, na.value, guide}{See \code{ggplot2::scale_colour_viridis_d} for more information}

\item{aesthetics}{Character string or vector of character strings listing the
name(s) of the aesthetic(s) that this scale works with. This can be useful, for
example, to apply colour settings to the `colour` and `fill` aesthetics at the
same time, via `aesthetics = c("colour", "fill")`.}
}
\description{
The `viridis` scales provide colour maps that are perceptually uniform in both
colour and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers
with common forms of colour blindness. See also
